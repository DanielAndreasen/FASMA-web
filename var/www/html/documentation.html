    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <h4>Preparing your data</h4>
    <p>In order to run FASMA your data needs to be correctly formatted. The line
    list needs to be formatted according to <a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html">MOOG.</a>
    The line list from the <a href="/ew.html">EW driver</a> will already be
    formatted correctly.</p>
    <p>The spectrum you wish to analysize should be 1D with the fluxes. The
    wavelength information should be stored in the header keywords: NAXIS1, CRVAL1,
    and CDELT1. For the EW driver there is no need to normalize the spectrum
    since this is done by ARES on the fly. However, the best results are found
    when the spectrum is as clean as possible. This includes removing cosmic,
    and other artifacts from the spectrum.</p>

    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>The way this web application is build it is only able to run one
    instance at the time. This means you will be put at the end of a queue
    when you submit a job. So please be patient when other jobs are finishing.
    Typical run time for the ARES driver is around 1 min, while it is up to
    7 min for getting parameters using the EW method (depending on the problem).</p>

    <p>Therefore we kindly ask you not to submit an unreasonable amount of jobs.
    If you wish to analyze a large sample of stars we are open for
    collaborations and we gladly offer our expertise on the fields presented in
    this web application.</p>

    <h4>Problems</h4>
    <p>If you have any problems running FASMA in any of the modes, please do
    not hesitate contacting the team. We will appreciate if you send as much
    information as possible so we can troubleshoot the problem. We refer to
    the <a href="/contact.html"></a>contact page for more information.</p>

    <h4>Future plans</h4>
    <p>We have a few plans for the future of FASMA. Currently we are working
    on a fitting method to get the parameters as well. This will be presented
    in another paper when it is ready and tested. We also wish to make the
    user experience even smoother by having a mode to get all the information
    available from the spectrum which FASMA can provide. This includes the
    parameters and abundances.</p>

    <h4>Make a standalone app</h4>
    <p>A standalone app can be made with <a href="https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier">
    nativefier</a>. This will make an executable on your laptop for easy access
    to FASMA. The app will work in exactly the same way as the online version.</p>
